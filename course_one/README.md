My solutions and code for the algorithms taught in [course one](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer/) of [Stanford's Algorithms specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms).

TODO:
- Fixing karger's mincut's implementation's "each edge is represented once" assumption.
- Closest Pair
- Strassen's Matrix Multiplication
- Deterministic Linear Time Selection
